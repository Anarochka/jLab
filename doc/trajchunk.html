 <a href="trajchunk.html">TRAJCHUNK</a>  Converts Lagrangian trajectories into chunks based on the Coriolis period.
 
    <a href="trajchunk.html">TRAJCHUNK</a> is used to split float or drifter data into chuncks such that
    the length of each chunk is a fixed multiple of the average Coriolis
    frequency. This is useful in spectral analysis. 
 
    [NUMO,LATO]=<a href="trajchunk.html">TRAJCHUNK</a>(NUM,LAT,P), where NUM and LAT are arrays of date
    number and latitude for float or drifter data, re-organizes these into 
    chunks such that the average Coriolis frequency f_C in each chunk is at 
    least P times the Rayleigh frequency f_R for that chunk.
 
    Recall that the Rayleigh frequency is f_R=2*pi/(DT*N), in units of 
    radians per unit time, where DT is the sample interval and N is the
    number of samples.
 
    The output variables NUM and LAT are now cell arrays of numerical
    arrays, with each cell is truncated such that its length is just long
    enough such that f_C > P * f_R.  
 
    Trajectories that are not long enough to satisfy this criterion are 
    discarded, as are short residual segments at the end of trajectories.   
 
    Each input trajectory is thus split into zero, one, or more than one
    cells in the output variables.

    Additional options
 
    [NUMO,LATO,Y1,Y2,...,YM]=<a href="trajchunk.html">TRAJCHUNK</a>(NUM,LAT,X1,X2,...XM,N) chunks the M
    input arrays X1, X2,... XM in the same manner, and returns these as Y1,
    Y2,... YM.  The YM are cell arrays of the same size as NUMO.
 
    <a href="trajchunk.html">TRAJCHUNK</a>(...,P,LMIN) also specifies a mininum number of points LMIN
    for each chunk.      
 
    <a href="trajchunk.html">TRAJCHUNK</a> with no output arguments overwrites the original named output
    variables. 
 
    [..,II]=<a href="trajchunk.html">TRAJCHUNK</a>(...), with an extra final output argument, 
    outputs a cell array II of indices to the original time series. 
 
    As an example, LAT(II{1}) gives the latitudes of the data in the first 
    cell of the output, LATO{1}.

    Keeping short data segments
 
    By default, any data is cells shorter than the specified length are 
    discarded, as are data segments at the end of the trajectories.  
 
    <a href="trajchunk.html">TRAJCHUNK</a>(...,'keep') keeps these instead.  Short cells are returned in
    their own chunks, and leftover segments are appended to the end of the 
    preceding chunk.  
 
    This preserves the number of data points, while favoring a requested 
    length, if possible, from each trajectory. 
    __________________________________________________________________
 
    Cell array input 
 
    The input variables NUM and LAT are cell arrays of numerical arrays,
    with one trajectory per cell, as with FLOATS.MAT and DRIFTERS.MAT.  For
    details on these datasets, see <a href="about_floats.html">ABOUT_FLOATS</a> and <a href="about_drifters.html">ABOUT_DRIFTERS</a>.
 
    In this case, the output variables are still 1D cell arrays of numeric
    arrays.  Chunks drawn from each successive trajectory are appended to 
    the end of the output cell arrays.   
 
    [...,II,KK]=<a href="trajchunk.html">TRAJCHUNK</a>(...) in this case also outputs the indices of
    the data locations within the input cells.  KK is not a cell array
    like the other output arguments, but rather a row array of LENGTH(II).
 
    As an example, LAT(KK(1))(II{1}) gives the latitudes of the data in the 
    first cell of the output, LATO{1}.

    Overlap
 
    <a href="trajchunk.html">TRAJCHUNK</a>(...,'overlap',PCT) outputs chunks with a percentage PCT 
    overlap.  For example, <a href="trajchunk.html">TRAJCHUNK</a>(...,'overlap',50) outputs chunks that 
    overlap by 50%.  The default behavior gives chunks with no overlap.
