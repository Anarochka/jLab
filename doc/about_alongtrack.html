    ALONGTRACK is a matfile containing the sea surface height anomalies
    from the integrated alongtrack altimetry dataset, available online at
 
      http://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset/MERGED_TP_J1_OSTM_OST_CYCLES_V2
 
    This dataset is produced by Brian Beckley and collaborators on NASA's
    Ocean Surface Topography Science Team (OSTST).  It contains data from
    the TOPEX/Poseidon, Jason-1, and OSTM/Jason-2 satelliets.
 
    ALONGTRACK.MAT is a slightly reorganized matfile version of the NetCDF 
    data distributed at PO.DAAC, and is redistributed with permission as a
    supplement to the software toolbox <a href="jLab.html">JLAB</a>. 
 
    Various processing steps have been carried out to remove bad data 
    points, as described below.
 
    LOAD ALONGTRACK loads the structure ALONGTRACK, containing the 
    following fields:
 
      alongtrack.about  Pointer to this document                   
      alongtrack.num    Cycle start in DATENUM format    [758 x 1]
      alongtrack.dnum   Days from cycle start date       [3375 x 254]
      alongtrack.lat    Latitude                         [3375 x 254]
      alongtrack.lon    Longitude                        [3375 x 254]
      alongtrack.atd    Along-track distance (km)        [3375 x 254]
      alongtrack.mss    Mean sea surface height (cm)     [3375 x 254]
      alongtrack.ssh    Sea surface height anomaly (cm)  [3375 x 254 x 758] 
      alongtrack.grid   Fields for mapping ssh to grid   Structure 
   
    The mean sea surface height is given in the PO.DAAC documentation as 
    being the DTU10 Global Gravity field of Anderson (2010). 
 
    Note that sea surface height is here given in centimeters. 
 
    The first dimension, of length 3375, is the number of measurements
    along each track.  The second, of dimension 254, is the number of 
    tracks split into their descending and ascending portions.  The third
    dimesion, of length 758, is the number of cycles. 
 
    After 'load alongtrack', type '<a href="use.html">use</a> alongtrack' to map the structure
    fields into named variables in the workspace--num, lat, lon, ssh, etc.
 
    The GRID field is described below under 'Mapping with POLYSMOOTH'.
 
    The figure shown at the top is standard deviation of sea surface
    height, mapped onto a regular grid with <a href="polysmooth.html">POLYSMOOTH</a> as described below.
    With <a href="jLab.html">JLAB</a> installed, it can be re-created with '<a href="about_alongtrack.html">about_alongtrack</a> --f'.
 
    ALONGTRACK.MAT is distributed as a part of <a href="jData.html">JDATA</a>, a supplement to the 
    software toolbox <a href="jLab.html">JLAB</a>, and is available at http://www.jmlilly.net.

    Time details
  
    NUM is the time at the beginning of each cycle, in Matlab's DATENUM 
    format. DNUM is the mean difference from this time, averaged over all 
    cycles, for each location along each track.  
 
    Deviations of the exact time differences from their mean values over
    all cycles are small, typically 5% of the mean values.   
 
    In order to save space, the exact times for each measurement are not 
    re-distributed here.  Instead DNUM is deduced from the exact time field
    available from PO.DAAC.
    __________________________________________________________________
    
    Organization
 
    The data has been re-organized somewhat from its original format.  Each
    track has been split into a descending and ascending portion. 
 
    All descending passes are presented first, but flipped north/south to 
    be sorted by the longitude of their southernmost point, beginning with 
    the first track having a southernmost point east of longitude -180.  
 
    Then all ascending passes are presented, also sorted from longitude 
    -180 based on their initial or southernmost point.
 
    This reorganization makes it easier to locate tracks that fall through
    particular latitude / longitude points.  Also, each row of SSH occurs
    at essentially the same latitude, so one can directly average the 
    alongtrack-data to get meaningful statistics across latitudes.
 
    The time offset from the cycle start time are therefore scrambled among
    the different tracks.  These time offsets are recorded in DNUM.
 
    The field ATD is the cumulative along-track distance from the initial 
    point of each track, as computed by <a href="spheredist.html">SPHEREDIST</a>.
 
    A figure illustrating the ALONGTRACK format is shown below.  This is 
    the standard deviation of sea surface height, as in the figure at the 
    top but without any mapping.  Each column is a track with ascending and
    descending tracks split.  The distorted view reflects the way the 
    satellite tracks actually sample the ocean.

    Processing
 
    Several processing steps have been applied to remove bad data points.  
    Firstly, all data over land has been set to NaNs, affecting a small 
    number of data points.  
 
    Secondly, all data at locations missing 3/4 or more of their values are
    set to NaNs.  This affects about 3% of all valid data points, and 
    primarily influences regions with seasonally varying ice cover.
 
    Finally, the data has been despiked, with the spikes set to NaNs.  This
    is done by looking at the statistics of the first central difference.  
 
    A representative standard deviation of this quantity is 4 cm.  All
    points having a first central difference with a magnitude exceeding
    three times this standard deviation, or 12 cm, are set to NaNs.  This 
    also affects about 3% of the valid data points.

    Mapping with POLYSMOOTH
 
    ALONGTRACK includes some pre-computed fields that are useful in mapping 
    the sea surface height to a regular grid using the <a href="polysmooth.html">POLYSMOOTH</a> function
    that is distributed as a part of <a href="jLab.html">JLAB</a>.   
 
    The GRID field is itself a structure containing the following fields:
 
      grid.lato   Latitudes for 1 x 1 degree gridding    [133 x 1]
      grid.lono   Longitudes for 1 x 1 degree gridding   [361 x 1] 
      grid.ds     Distances from data to grid point      [133 x 361 x 1701]
      grid.xs     X-location of data from grid points    [133 x 361 x 1701]
      grid.ys     Y-location of data from grid points    [133 x 361 x 1701]
      grid.index  Index into locations of sorted data    [133 x 361 x 1701]
    
    These fields characterize all latitude and longititude observations
    points that are less than a cutoff distance of 250 kilometers from each 
    point on a 1 degree x 1 degree grid, as output by <a href="spheresort.html">SPHERESORT</a>.
 
    To map the standard deviation of sea surface variance, for instance, 
    use INDEX to locate the nearest observations for each grid point
 
        sshstd=<a href="vstd.html">vstd</a>(ssh,3);
        zs=nan*zeros(size(xs));
        zs(~isnan(index))=sshstd(index(~isnan(index)));
 
    and then call <a href="polysmooth.html">POLYSMOOTH</a> with the fields DS, XS, YS, and ZS.
 
    The figure shown at top is generated with a first-order fit by 
    <a href="polysmooth.html">POLYSMOOTH</a> using a variable fit radius that grabs the nearest 70 data
    points.  This is augmented very near to coastlines by blending with a 
    zeroth-order fit that grabs the nearest 100 data points.  
 
    See <a href="spheresort.html">SPHERESORT</a> and <a href="polysmooth.html">POLYSMOOTH</a> for details.

    Dataset creation
 
    The NetCDF file on which ALONGTRACK.MAT is based are available for 
    download from PO.DAAC as follows 
 
        ftp  ftp://podaac-ftp.jpl.nasa.gov
        cd   allData/merged_alt/preview/L2/TP_J1_OSTM/all
        get  Merged_TOPEX_Jason_OSTM_Version_V2.3.nc.gz
   
    For completeness, the m-file ALONGTRACK also contains the processing 
    steps used in the creation of the corresponding matfile.  This 
    requires that the current version of <a href="jLab.html">JLAB</a> is on your search path.
 
    Then 'alongtrack --create' will recreate ALONGTRACK.MAT by reading in
    the NetCDF file as downloaded from PO.DAAC. This will take a while.
 
    You'll need to make sure to put the directory containing the file on
    your Matlab search path using ADDPATH, e.g. 'addpath ~/Data/beckley'.
